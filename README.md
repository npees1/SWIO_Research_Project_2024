# SWIO_Research_Project_2024
SWIO research project is an international project that works on finding the hidden divergence within species and trace the ancestral population of Aedes Aegypti, one of the world's most dangerous vectors spreading deadly viruses like Zika, Dengue, Chikungunya and Yellow fever. In a recent discovery from the Powell lab of Yale University regarding the origin and spread of this mosquito is found to be emerged on Madagascar and islands in the Indian Ocean approximately more than 7 million years ago. Earlier, it was thought that the mosquito was originated in Continental Africa and spread all over the world via slave trade and European colonization around 500 years ago. 

This characteristics is found in Aedes Aegypti mosquito nearest populations collectively called Aegypti group which are of focus now.
